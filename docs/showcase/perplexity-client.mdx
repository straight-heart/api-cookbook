**Perplexity Client** is an Electron-based desktop application that provides a polished interface for interacting with Perplexity's Sonar API. Unlike typical chat interfaces, it exposes advanced API parameters like temperature, top-p, and max tokens, making it ideal for developers who want fine-grained control over their AI interactions while enjoying a beautiful, macOS-inspired UI.
